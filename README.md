# Chatbot Assignment

You will be writing a Chatbot program that uses Scanner to ask the user several questions
about themselves, and then makes a response to the user based on that question. 

Your program should ask the user 5 different questions about themselves. However, the 
first question that your program must ask is: "What is your name?"

Here is an example of how your program might look like:

```shell script
What is your name? Nathan
Hello, Nathan! It's nice to meet you!

What is your favorite color, Nathan? Blue
Oh I like Blue too!

... 
```

Note that in the above example, the user inputted the name "Nathan" and then "Blue". Your program should work
for any name that the user types in.

Add code to [MyMain.java](src/main/java/MyMain.java) to do the desired thing.

## Run your code with:
```shell script
make run
```
Or go to [MyMain.java](src/main/java/MyMain.java) and click on `Run` above the `main()` method.

## Run your tests with:
```shell script
make test
```
